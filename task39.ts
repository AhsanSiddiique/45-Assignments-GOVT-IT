function city_country(city: string, country: string): string {return `${city}, ${country}`;}
// return was used here to retuen the value as i have removed the string unown here 

console.log(city_country('Karachi', 'Pakistan'));
console.log(city_country('Tokya', 'Japan'));
console.log(city_country('Dubai', 'UAE'));
